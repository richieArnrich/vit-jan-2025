            Cascading Style Sheets
=======================================================================
CSS: Cascading style Sheets
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to control the layout and appearance of
web pages written in HTML or XML.
CSS is used to separate the presentation of a document from its structure, which makes it easier 
to maintain and update the layout of a web page.

--------------------------------------------------
Types of styling:
1. Inline styling: This is the most basic form of styling, where the style is applied directly
to an HTML element using the style attribute.
Eg: <h1 style="color: blue">This is Heading</h1>
2. Internal styling: This is where the style is defined within the HTML document itself,
using the <style> tag.
Eg: <style>
        h1 {
            color: blue;
        }
    </style>
3. External styling: This is where style is applied in an external .css file and linked to html
using <link> tag

CSS selectors
----------------------------------------------
CSS selectors are used to select HTML elements and apply styles to them.
Types of selectors:
1. Universal selector(*): selects all the elements in the html page
2. Tag selector: selects all the elements of a particular tag name
3. Class selector: selects all the elements with a particular class name
4. ID selector: selects a single element with a particular id
-----------------------------------------------
CSS specificity 
-----------------------------------------------
CSS specificity is a measure of how specific a CSS selector is.
The specificity of a selector is determined by the number of ID, class, and tag 
selectors it contains.

Order of specificity:
1. ID selector (#id)
2. Class selector (.class)
3. Tag selector (tag)
4. Universal selector

CSS Display Property
--------------------------------------------
The display property in CSS is used to specify how an element should be displayed.
There are several values for the display property, including:
a. inline: elements are displayed as inline elements in a single row
b. block: elements are displayed as block elements, taking up the full width of their parent element
c. inline-block: elements are displayed as inline elements, but can have a width and height

CSS Position property
--------------------------------------------------------
The position property in CSS is used to specify the position of an element relative to its parent element.
Types of positions in css:
1. static: the default position of an element, it is placed according to the normal document flow
2. relative: the element is placed according to the normal document flow, but can be moved relative
to its normal position
3. absolute: the element is removed from the normal document flow and is placed relative to its nearest
ancestor that has a position other than static
4. fixed : the element stays fixed in a given point on the screen
5. sticky: the element has the behaviour of relative and fixed, relative upto a threshold point and 
fixed after that.
