Aggreagation Pipeline in MongoDB
The aggregation pipeline is a powerful tool in MongoDB that allows you to perform complex data processing and analysis on large datasets. It is a series of stages that process the data in a pipeline fashion, allowing you to perform various operations such as filtering, grouping, sorting, and more.

Stages in aggregation pipeline:-
1. $match: This stage filters the documents based on a specified condition.
2. $project: This stage projects the fields that you want to include in the output.
3. $lookup: This stage looks into a foreign collection with the mentioned keys
4. $group: This stage groups the documents based on a specified key.
5. $sort: This stage sorts the documents based on a specified key.
