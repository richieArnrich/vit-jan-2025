                Node JS
=========================================================================
What is NodeJS?
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side. It provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

Modules in NodeJS
-----------------
Node.js is built on the concept of modules. A module is a self-contained piece of code that
can be used in other parts of the application(reusable). Node.js has a built-in module system that allows developers to easily import and use modules in their code.

Types of modules:-
1. Built-in modules: These are modules that come pre-installed with Node.js. They are
available for use without any additional installation. Examples include the 'http' and 'fs' modules.
2. Third-party modules: These are modules that are not part of the Node.js core but can
be installed using the npm package manager. Examples include the 'express' and 'mongodb' modules.
3. Custom modules: These are modules that are created by developers for their own use. They
can be used in other parts of the application.
